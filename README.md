# Wastelands
This project was submitted to Brooklyn Hacks. The project is a game centered around picking up trash off the map. You can unlock upgrades along the way to speed up picking trash. The game can be played by downloading one of the .jar files from the repository. LibGDX and Java was used to create the game.

Credits to BexzodA for doing the UI and Niuland for the art.
